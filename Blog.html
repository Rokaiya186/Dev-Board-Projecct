  <!-- Question Answer Section -->
  <p>Question-1: What are the different ways to select an element in the DOM? <br>
    Answer: There are many ways to select an element such as getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector, and querySelectorAl.</p><br> <br>
  <p>Question-2: What is the difference between       innerHTML, innerText, and textContent ? <br>
    Answer:The key differences between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent lie in how they access and manipulate the content of an HTML element:
    innerHTML:
    Retrieves or sets the HTML markup within an element, including all HTML tags and spacing.
    innerText:
    Retrieves the rendered text content of an element, excluding HTML tags and hidden elements due to CSS styling.
    textContent:
    Retrieves the raw text content of an element, including hidden elements and whitespace, but without any HTML tags</p><br><br>
    <p>Question-3: What is event delegation in the DOM? <br>
    Answer:Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where a single event listener is attached to a parent element instead of attaching event listeners to multiple child elements.</p><br><br>
    <p>Question-4: What is event bubbling in the DOM?<br>
      When an event occurs on an element, it first triggers the event handlers on that element itself (known as the target phase), and then bubbles up to its parent elements, continuing up to the root of the document. This allows parent elements to also respond to events that occur on their child elements.
    </p><br><br>
    <p>Question-5: How do you create, add, and remove elements using JavaScript?<br>
      In this approach, we are using the createElement() method to dynamically add a new HTML tag and the removeChild method to remove it. This approach provides more control over the newly created tag and allows for efficient addition and removal of the tag from the DOM
